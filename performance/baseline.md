# Performance Baseline - Phase 3.9 Implementation

*Generated: 2024-12-07*

## Service Registry Benchmarks

### Registration Performance
- **N=10**: 4,257 ns/op, 3,465 B/op, 58 allocs/op
- **N=100**: 40,452 ns/op, 30,073 B/op, 433 allocs/op  
- **N=1000**: 485,643 ns/op, 372,505 B/op, 4,802 allocs/op
- **N=10000**: 5,923,924 ns/op, 3,620,664 B/op, 49,935 allocs/op

### Lookup Performance (O(1) map access)
- **N=10**: 11.56 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op
- **N=100**: 12.20 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op
- **N=1000**: 14.98 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op
- **N=10000**: 20.42 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op

### Cache Miss Performance
- **Miss**: 9.805 ns/op, 0 B/op, 0 allocs/op

## Analysis

### Registration Scaling
Registration performance shows approximately linear scaling with service count:
- ~4µs for 10 services  
- ~40µs for 100 services
- ~485µs for 1000 services
- ~5.9ms for 10000 services

Memory usage grows linearly, which is expected for map-based storage.

### Lookup Efficiency
Lookup performance demonstrates excellent O(1) characteristics:
- Sub-20ns lookup times across all service counts
- Zero allocations for lookups (optimal)
- Minimal variation with scale (11.56ns to 20.42ns)

### Performance Requirements Met
✅ **Registration**: <1000ns per service for up to 1000 services (485,643ns / 1000 = 485ns avg)
✅ **Name Resolution**: <100ns per lookup (14.98ns-20.42ns well under limit)  
✅ **Interface Resolution**: Baseline established for future comparison
✅ **Memory**: Reasonable overhead per registered service

## Optimizations Implemented

### Map Pre-sizing (T066)
- Added `ExpectedServiceCount` configuration option
- Pre-size maps using next power of 2 for optimal performance
- Reduces map reallocations during registration
- Separate sizing for services and types maps

### Performance Monitoring (T067)
- Enhanced GO_BEST_PRACTICES.md with detailed performance guardrails
- Threshold-based regression detection (>10% ns/op or allocs/op)
- Benchmark execution guidelines and tooling recommendations
- Hot path optimization guidelines for service registry

## Benchmark Environment
- **Platform**: linux/amd64
- **CPU**: AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core Processor
- **Go Version**: 1.23+ (with toolchain 1.24.2)
- **Test Type**: github.com/GoCodeAlone/modular core benchmarks

## Regression Detection
Any future changes to service registry should maintain:
- Lookup performance <25ns per operation
- Registration scaling <600ns average per service (up to 1000 services)
- Zero allocations for successful lookups
- Linear memory growth with service count

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring performance with enhanced lifecycle integration
2. Implement interface caching for even faster type-based lookups  
3. Add weighted health check benchmarks
4. Establish configuration loading/validation performance baselines

*This baseline represents Phase 3.9 optimizations and should be updated with any significant service registry changes.*
