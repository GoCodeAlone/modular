---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An application developer wants to rapidly assemble a production-ready, modular backend application by composing independently developed feature modules (e.g., HTTP server, authentication, caching, database, scheduling) that declare their configuration, dependencies, lifecycle behaviors, and optional multi-tenant awareness. The developer supplies configuration via multiple sources, starts the application once, and expects deterministic ordering, automatic validation, observability hooks, and graceful startup/shutdown across all modules without needing to hand-craft dependency wiring.

### Supporting Personas
- Application Developer: Assembles and runs the composed application.
- Module Author: Creates reusable modules that conform to framework interfaces and offer services.
- Operator / DevOps: Provides configuration (env, files), monitors lifecycle events, manages secrets and rotation.
- Tenant Administrator: Manages tenant-specific configuration and isolation boundaries.
- Security / Compliance Reviewer: Verifies auth, auditing, and isolation guarantees.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a set of modules each declaring required services and configuration, **When** the application initializes, **Then** the framework MUST resolve dependencies (by name or interface), apply defaults, validate all configuration, and start modules in an order that satisfies dependencies.
2. **Given** a module fails during Start after some modules already started, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the framework MUST emit lifecycle events, stop all previously started startable modules in reverse order, and return a wrapped error describing the failure cause.
3. **Given** multiple configuration feeders (environment variables, file-based, programmatic), **When** the application loads configuration, **Then** the system MUST merge them respecting precedence rules and track which feeder provided each field for auditing.
4. **Given** a multi-tenant application with tenant-specific configs, **When** per-tenant services are requested, **Then** the framework MUST provide isolated instances without cross-tenant leakage.
5. **Given** a module exposes services through the service registry, **When** another module requests those services by interface or explicit name, **Then** the lookup MUST succeed if a compatible provider exists or produce a descriptive error if not.
6. **Given** observers are registered, **When** lifecycle or configuration events occur, **Then** observers MUST receive structured event data in deterministic sequence without blocking the core lifecycle (or with defined handling of slow observers).
7. **Given** the CLI tool is used to generate a new module skeleton, **When** the developer runs the generation command, **Then** the scaffold MUST include required interface implementations and documentation placeholders.
8. **Given** a graceful shutdown is triggered, **When** the application stops, **Then** all stoppable modules MUST receive stop signals in reverse start order, ensuring resource cleanup.
9. **Given** configuration contains invalid values (missing required, type mismatch, failed custom validation), **When** validation runs, **Then** startup MUST abort with aggregated, actionable error messages referencing fields and sources.
10. **Given** circular dependencies between modules exist, **When** the application is built or started, **Then** the system MUST detect and report the cycle without deadlock.

### Edge Cases
- Circular dependency chain across >2 modules.
- Missing required configuration field after applying all defaults and feeders.
- Multiple providers for the same interface where selection rules are ambiguous.
- Module requests a service that becomes available only after its own Start (ordering mis-declaration).
- Failure during partial multi-tenant initialization leaves some tenants initialized and others not.
- Rapid successive tenant configuration updates while services are in use.
- Slow or failing observer causing potential lifecycle delays (handling/backpressure requirement).
- Configuration feeder unavailable (e.g., file missing, env not set) yet marked required.
- Reverse proxy / HTTP server module bound port already in use at startup.
- Scheduler job execution overlapping previous long-running instance.
- Certificate (Let's Encrypt) renewal failure near expiry.
- Auth module key rotation occurring during active token validation.
- Event bus subscriber panic or processing timeout.
- Cache backend network partition.
- Database connection pool exhaustion under burst load.

### Clarified Constraints & Previously Open Items
- Performance Targets: Framework bootstrap (10 modules) SHOULD complete < 200ms on baseline modern VM; configuration load for up to 1000 fields SHOULD complete < 2s; average service lookup MUST be O(1) expected time. These act as guidance baselines, not hard SLAs.
- Data Retention: Configuration provenance tracking data SHOULD be retainable for 30 days (policy hook provided) with ability to plug extended archival. Sensitive secrets MUST NOT be stored in provenance values (only source reference, redacted value indicator).
- Compliance Alignment: Logging & auditing facilities MUST enable generation of evidence for SOC2 style controls (startup/shutdown events, configuration validation results, error classifications). No specific HIPAA/PII handling mandated in baseline.
- Observability Cardinality: Metrics/tracing tags SHOULD avoid unbounded cardinality; default guardrails MUST warn when >100 distinct values for a single tag within a rolling 10m window.
- Tenant Scaling: Baseline target support is 100 concurrently active tenants per process; framework MUST remain functionally correct up to 500 tenants (performance may degrade); beyond 500 is a scaling strategy consideration (sharding / multi-process).
- Archival & Deletion: Framework provides hooks; enforcement of domain-specific retention/deletion logic is responsibility of application modules.
- Security Keys & Secrets: Secrets MUST be injectable through feeders and MUST never be logged in plaintext (redaction required).
- Backward Compatibility: Minor version updates MUST maintain stable public module interfaces; breaking changes only in a major version with deprecation notice of ‚â•1 minor release.

### Non-Functional Highlights (Derived & Finalized)
- Reliability: Graceful shutdown & reverse start ordering required; failed start triggers coordinated rollback.
- Observability: Provenance tracking, lifecycle events, health aggregation, ambiguity diagnostics; guardrails on metric cardinality.
- Extensibility: Modules, decorators, feeders, observers, and error taxonomy are open extension points.
- Security: Tenant isolation, secret redaction, pluggable auth, controlled dynamic config.
- Performance: Bootstrap (<200ms for 10 modules), config load (<2s for 1000 fields), O(1) average service lookup guideline.
- Scalability: 100 active tenants baseline (functional to 500) + horizontal scaling pattern; 500 services per process guideline.
- Maintainability: Semantic versioning policy; deprecation cycle = 1 minor release.
- Operability: Health/readiness model and structured events enable automation tooling.

### Measurable Success Criteria (Guidance / Regression Guards)
| Area | Metric | Target P50 | Target P95 |
|------|--------|-----------:|-----------:|
| Bootstrap (baseline app) | Time to Ready | <150ms | <300ms |
| Configuration Load | Load & validate duration | <1.0s | <2.0s |
| Service Lookup | Average lookup latency | <2¬µs | <10¬µs |

| Health Aggregation (planned) | Cycle processing | <5ms | <15ms |
| Auth Token Validation (expanded) | Validation latency | <3ms | <8ms |
| Scheduler Catch-up Decision | Evaluation latency | <20ms | <50ms |
| Secret Redaction | Leakage incidents | 0 | 0 |
Policy: Sustained breach of any P95 target (>25% over for two consecutive periods) triggers review.

### Acceptance Test Plan (Planned Enhancements)
| FR | Focus | Representative Acceptance Scenarios (Abstract) |
|----|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 005 | Service Scope | Services register with scope; listings show scope; invalid scope rejected |
| 014 | Tenant Guard Option | Strict blocks tenant-scoped access w/out context; permissive allows fallback |

| 029/039 | Scheduler Catch-up | Disabled: no backfill; Enabled: bounded backfill; excess backlog truncated |
| 032 | Certificate Escalation | Renewal failures near expiry emit escalation events; service continuity maintained |
| 038 | Isolation & Leakage | Distinct tenant resources; no cross-tenant access in strict mode |
| 044 | Service Tie-break | Name > priority > registration time; equal all -> clear ambiguity error |
| 045 | Dynamic Reload | Dynamic field changes reload; static change flagged for restart |
| 046 | Error Taxonomy | Categories emitted & reported; custom category extension works |
| 048 | Aggregate Health/Readiness | Optional failures excluded from readiness; degraded states surfaced |
