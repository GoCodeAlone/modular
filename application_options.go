package modular

// application_options.go contains the production implementation of application options
// for dynamic reload and health aggregation features.
//
// Note: The test file application_options_test.go defines the test-specific interfaces
// and implementations. This file provides the actual production integration with
// the modular application framework.

// This file serves as the production implementation that integrates the application options
// with the StdApplication framework. The test file defines the contract that this
// production code should satisfy.

// The actual integration will be implemented as part of enhancing the StdApplication
// to support dynamic reload and health aggregation features, registering the appropriate
// services during application initialization when these options are enabled.
